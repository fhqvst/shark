Trading terminals these days are way too complicated and expensive to use. My hopes are that this will be a good enough replacement for all of us who aren't interested in paying $300 a month for features we don't need and much less use. 

The project is currently in alpha stage, and there are still quite a lot of features I'd like to add. These include, among other things:
* Notifications based on price movements
* Information from FI's "Insynslistan"
* Custom watchlists
* Some sort of diary
* Twitter integration

Features that will _not_ be added include:
* Advanced graphing tools
* Anything related to technical analysis
